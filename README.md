Introduction
------------
CASES promotes information security through the use of behavioral,
organizational and technical measures. Depending on its size and its security
needs, organizations must react in the most appropriate manner.
Adopting good practices, taking the necessary measures and adjusting them
proportionally: all this is part of the process to ensure information security.
Most of all, it depends on performing a risk analysis on a regular basis.

Although the profitability of the risk analysis approach is guaranteed, the
investment represented by this approach in terms of the required cost and
expertise is a barrier for many companies, especially SMEs.

To remedy this situation and allow all organizations, both large and small, to
benefit from the advantages that a risk analysis offers, CASES has developed an
optimised risk analysis method: MONARC (Method for an Optimised aNAlysis of
  Risks by CASES), allowing precise and repeatable risk management.

The advantage of MONARC lies in the capitalization of risk analyses already
performed in similar business contexts: the same vulnerabilities
regularly appear in many businesses, as they face the same threats and generate
similar risks. Most companies have servers, printers, a fleet of smartphones,
Wi-Fi antennas, etc. therefore the vulnerabilities and threats are the same.
It is therefore sufficient to generalize risk scenarios for these assets (also
called objects) by context and/or business.
